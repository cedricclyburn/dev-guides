== The AI Journey for an Application Developer

It's important to understand the different steps of the journey to learning, understanding, and working with AI as a developer. 

== Goals of this lab

As a developer at Parasol Insurance, your first step is to start learning and experimenting with AI for enterprise applications. In this section, you'll understand how you can work with the Podman AI Lab for building AI-enabled applications. You will accomplish this with the following steps:

* *Learn* about the Podman AI Lab and how it can accelerate developer productivity for building applications using Generative AI.
* *Test* out the different features of the AI Lab, including the model catalog, playground environments, and more.
* *Deploy* a basic summarization application in order to quickly understand insurance claims.

== 1. Getting Started your developer environment for Generative AI

=== 1.1. Understanding Podman Desktop and AI Lab

We'll be using https://podman-desktop.io[Podman Desktop], an open-source graphical interface for managing containers, pods, and images on your local system. It provides a user-friendly way for developers in our organization to work with containerized applications and services. The https://podman-desktop.io/extensions/ai-lab[AI Lab extension] for Podman Desktop is a powerful tool that allows developers to explore and experiment with various AI models and applications locally, and we'll learn how to use it to kick-start our discovery and usage of generative AI.

=== 1.2. Key Components of Podman AI Lab

With Podman AI Lab, we're provided a curated catalog of open-source recipes, ready-to-use models, and playgrounds for common generative AI use cases. The main components include the following:

* *Recipes Catalog*: A collection of pre-built AI applications and use cases that demonstrate real-world implementations of AI models.
* *Open Source Models*: A curated list of AI models that can be easily downloaded and used, with information on their licenses and capabilities.
* *Playground Environments*: Interactive spaces to test and experiment with different models, allowing developers to specify model parameters and observe results.
* *Model Serving*: Capability to run local inference servers for AI models, providing an OpenAI-compatible endpoint for application integration.

== 2. Exploring the Podman AI Lab Interface

Your developer environment includes Podman Desktop pre-installed with the AI Lab extension, allowing you to instantly get started exploring and working with Generative AI in your application development workflow. From the extensions sidebar of Podman Desktop, navigate to the AI Lab icon.

=== 2.1. Viewing the Model Catalog

The Model Catalog is a key component of Podman AI Lab, providing developers with a curated list of open-source AI models and Large Language Models (LLMs). Select the *Models / Catalog* from the menu.

IMAGE

The Model Catalog interface is organized into four distinct tabs, each serving a specific purpose:

* All: Displays the complete list of catalog models. Models that have been downloaded are easily identifiable by their green highlighted icon.
* Downloaded: Shows only the models that have been stored locally on your machine, ready for offline use.
* Imported: Lists any custom models you've imported that weren't originally part of the catalog.
* Available: Presents all catalog models that are yet to be downloaded.

[NOTE] It's important to note that all models in the Podman AI Lab catalog are licensed under Apache 2.0. This permissive open-source license grants users the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software, while also providing patent rights.


=== 2.2. Testing out Playground Environments

=== 2.3. Model Serving and Integration

== 3. Getting Started from Recipes

== 3.1. Expanding Features

try text summarization recipe, upload claim PDF, view summarization

== 3.2. Basic Prompt Engineering

== Conclusion

We hope you have enjoyed this module!

Here is a quick summary of what we have learned:

- TBD
- TBD
- TBD

OLD:

// == 3. Kill playground, 

// == 4. Open summarization app (python) in vscode, inspect code (briefly)

// == 5. Change the prompt, restart, and observe changes.

// == 1. Run Podman Desktop

// Introduction to generative AI and discover and experiment with gen AI models and AI applications on the local desktop, in an inner loop development environment.

// image::discovery/redhat-openshift-ai.png[]

// As a Developer at Parasol Insurance, the first step in your AI journey will be to use RHEL AI (Red Hat's foundation model platform to seamlessly develop, test, and run LLMs for enterprise applications) and Podman Desktop AI Lab extension to discover and experiment with a variety of generative AI models and understand the relationship between model, model server, and the application.

// The goal of this exercise is to equip you with the basic knowledge and skills to be able to identify suitable AI models for different tasks, understand their underlying mechanisms, and see examples of application integration with the underlying model.
